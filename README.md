# Spring-CS1 Problem 0

## Hand-In Procedure 
1. Save Save your code in ps0.py. Do not ignore this step or save your file(s) with different names. 
2. At the start of each file, in a comment, write down the number of hours (roughly) you spent on the problems in that part, and the names of the people you collaborated with. 
3. Copy the URL from your work on GitHub and paste it into our LMS under Problem O.

## Problem 0. Write a program that does the following in order: 

1. Asks the user to enter his/her last name. 
2. Asks the user to enter his/her first name. 
3. Prints out the user’s first and last names in that order. An example of an interaction with your program is shown below (the words printed in blue are from the computer, based on your commands, the words in black are a user’s input – the colors are simply here to help you distinguish the two components): 

Enter your last name: **Grimson 

Enter your first name: **eric eric Grimson 

Hints: To see how to use the command, you may find it convenient to look at the [input and output section](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Input_and_Output) of the Python Wikibook. 

This will show you how to use statements to print out values of strings. To see how to read input from a user’s console into the Python environment, you may find it convenient to [look at the same section (see for example the function)](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Variables_and_Strings). 

Remember that if you want to hold onto a value, you need to store it in a variable (i.e., give it a name to which you can refer when you want that value). You may find it convenient to look at the variables and strings section of the Python Wikibook.
